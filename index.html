                My name is Austen Hsiao and I am a graduate student at Portland State University (PSU). 
                <br><br>
                I am a big fan of basketball and I love to cook. 
                <br><br>
                This webpage was created as part of a course at PSU to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                <br><br>
                I really enjoy the creative and colorful aspect of developing a website.
                <br><br>
                I am much more familiar with backend development, which is definitely not as pretty!
                <br><br>
                This website contains a little bit about myself and the work I have done

                    <h3>Robby the Robot (1/2)</h3>
                    <p>
                    Robby lives in a 10x10 board that is riddled with cans. Robby can either move in any of the cardinal directions, stay put, pick up a can, or move randomly. If Robby 
                    picks up a can, he gets 10 points. If he crashes into a wall, he loses 5 points and if he tries to mistakenly pick up a can, he loses 1 point.
                    In class, we talked about genetic algorithms, these are algorithms derived from organic sources. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the case of Robby, I programmed a method that mimics DNA replication-- this is a widely known algorithm. 
                    Each individual path Robby takes can be considered as a chromosome. If we initially start with random paths, Robby will obviously perform
                    poorly. However, if we take his two best trials and splice them together (randomly), we can improve his score over the course of many iterations.
                    The straight-forward way to implement a robot on a board is with recursion. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Using recursion, the naive method looks at the current square. If there is a can, Robby picks it up and he gets 10 points. Then Robby looks 
                    around him, moving to the first square Robby sees a can (in the order: left, right, up, down). If Robby does not see any cans, he moves 
                    randomly. I tested this method by running Robby on 1000 randomly generated 10-by-10 boards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Using a genetic approach, Robby's path is first randomly generated as a string of 243 characters (if Robby can see 5 places-- N, W, S, E, and the current square, and there
                    are three possible configurations in each square-- wall, can, no can, then the total combination is 3^5 or 243). Each set of strings comprises a single generation. Each generation was defined in my code as having 200 members.
                    Each string (which can be thought of as chromosomes) is then run with a 'fitness' algorithm to determine how well it performs; the higher the better. The top 2 performing chromosomes 
                    are used to 'breed' the next generation. To create the children, a random number between 0 and 243 is chosen which represents the character at which we splice 
                    the two parents together. Much like in organic DNA replication, a small chance of mutation occurs. At each character, I specified a 1-in-200 chance of random mutation. Each child is then run for fitness
                    and the pattern repeats itself until we hit the specified number of generations, arbitrarily specified as 1000. In order to minimize the chance that Robby is learning a single board, the fitness for each
                    chromosome is calculated as the average score over 50 randomly generated boards, all starting at (5,5).
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                    (Left) Shows a sample board in which the star is Robby. Roughly half of the positions on the board are occupied by cans in my code. (Right) Shows the results for the genetic algorithm. The maximum 
                    fitness score was plotted for each generation. Early generations yield poor results, suggesting poor optimization on any given board-- this is expected however, due to randomly initialized paths. As
                    each generation passes, subsequent optimization improves to a maximum ~260 points. This data was collected using 1000 generations of 200 members. In contrast, the naive (recursive) method reports an average score
                    of ~14 over the course of 1000 boards.

                    <h3>Secret Spot App (2/2)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Secret Spot (Formerly named Forage App) is an application developed by me and two other students at Portland State University. 
                        The application was developed as a method for people to organize their foraging locations -- think mushrooms, berries, etc. 
                        Users can create new location markers specified by a name, species found, additional comments, and a latitude/longitude. 
                        Centering on a stored location also displays the local weather forecast to allow planning for foraging trips. 
                        APIs used include Google Map API and OpenWeather. We deployed <a href="https://forage-app-pdx.herokuapp.com/">our app on Heroku</a>.
