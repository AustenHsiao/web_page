#### A personal website
___
This personal website was created as part of a course on web development. The requirements were 4 sections-- "About", "Previous work", "Projects", and "Contact". 
Each section of the page is stacked vertically with a very simple color-scheme. The projects I chose to highlight are shown in a carousel format. The contact form 
is overlayed on the screen when the button is clicked. The site is deployed on GitHub: https://austenhsiao.github.io/web_page/.

To run:
Open the HTML in any browser.
